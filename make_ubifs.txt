From information on how to create a UBIFS image. refer create an UBIFS image

    mkfs.ubifs

 [root@localhost]# cd /home/<user>/mtd/install/sbin
 [root@localhost]# ./mkfs.ubifs -r <target_fs> -F -o ubifs.img -m 2048 -e 126976 -c 1580



Where:

-m 2KiB (or 2048)
The minimum I/O size of the underlying UBI and MTD devices. In our case, we are running the flash with no sub-page writes, so this is a 2KiB page.
-e 124KiB (or 126976)
Erase Block Size: UBI requires 2 minimum I/O units out of each Physical Erase Block (PEB) for overhead: 1 for maintaining erase count information, and 1 for maintaining the Volume ID information. The PEB size for the XO flash is 128KiB, so this leads to each Logical Erase Block (LEB) having 124KiB available for data.
-c 1580
The maximum size, in LEBs, of this file system. See calculation below for how this number is determined.
-r filesystem
Use the contents of the 'filesystem/' directory to generate the initial file system image.

-F

File-system free space has to be fixed up on first mount (http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubifs.html#L_free_space_fixup)
-o ubifs.img
Output file. 

The output of the above command, ubifs.img is fed into the 'ubinize' program to wrap it into a UBI image.

  The images produced by mkfs.ubifs must be further fed to the ubinize tool to create a UBI image which must be put to the raw flash to be used a UBI partition. 


    Create ubinize.cfg file and write the contents into it

 
 [root@localhost]# cd /home/<user>/mtd/install/sbin
 [root@localhost]# vi ubinize.cfg

  [ubifs]               <== Section header
  mode=ubi              <== Volume mode (other option is static)
  image=ubifs.img       <== Source image
  vol_id=0              <== Volume ID in UBI image
  vol_size=192MiB       <== Volume size
  vol_type=dynamic      <== Allow for dynamic resize
  vol_name=rootfs       <== Volume name
  vol_flags=autoresize  <== Autoresize volume at first mount

[See calculations below to determine the value associated with 'vol_size']

    ubinize

 
 [root@localhost]# cd /home/<user>/mtd/install/sbin
 [root@localhost]# ./ubinize -o ubi.img -m 2048 -p 128KiB -s 512 -O 2048 ubinize.cfg

Where:
-o ubi.img
Output file
-m 2KiB (or 2048)
Minimum flash I/O size of 2KiB page
-p 128KiB

Size of the physical eraseblock of the flash this UBI image is created for

-O 2048 offset if the VID header from start of the physical eraseblock

The output of the above command, 'ubi.img' is the required image.






Some comments about what the options mean:

    -r root-fs: tells mkfs.ubifs to create an UBIFS image which would have identical contents as the local root-fs directory;
    -m 2048: tells mkfs.ubifs that the minimum input/output unit size of the flash this UBIFS image is created for is 2048 bytes (NAND page in this case);
    -e 129024: logical eraseblock size of the UBI volume this image is created for;
    -c 2047: specifies maximum file-system size in logical eraseblocks; this means that it will be possible to use the resulting file-system on volumes up to this size (less or equivalent); so in this particular case, the resulting FS may be put on volumes up to about 251MiB (129024 multiplied by 2047); See this section for more details.
    -p 128KiB: tells ubinize that physical eraseblock size of the flash chip the UBI image is created for is 128KiB (128 * 1024 bytes);
    -s 512: tells ubinize that the flash supports sub-pages and sub-page size is 512 bytes; ubinize will take this into account and put the VID header to the same NAND page as the EC header.
